Project 644: Path Planning Algorithms
Description:
Path planning is the process of determining a feasible route from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles. In robotics, path planning algorithms are crucial for guiding robots through environments, whether they're indoor or outdoor, to achieve a task efficiently. In this project, we will implement a path planning algorithm such as *A (A-star)**, a widely used algorithm that finds the shortest path in a grid environment with obstacles.
